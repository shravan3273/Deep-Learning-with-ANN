Deep Learning with ANN- Classification problem

About dataset: This dataset contains 10000 observations and 14 features, containing information of the customers of a bank. During six months, bank looked for each customer, if the customer stayed or left the bank within a period of six months. This result whether customer stayed or left is given in last column "exited" Our goal is to make model where we can predict this result exited(0 or 1) from the given independent variables.
